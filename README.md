## :package: How to Install
No installation is required, simply clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebooks using a Python environment that has the required libraries installed.
```bash
# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/niightingale/bep_tools.git
```
Keep in mind that an understanding of how the modeling suite within [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) works is required to properly understand how the code works and should be used.

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Use
Most of the core functionality within this repository can be accessed via Jupyter notebooks. These can be opened using [Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/). During the project [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was exclusively used, which implies that correct functionality can only be guaranteed using that editor together with the usual Jupyter extensions ([Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter), [Jupyter Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-keymap) and [Jupyter Notebook Renderers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers))
